## Project Overview

**AutoSketchAI** utilizes cutting-edge AI and serverless architecture to provide a seamless experience for sketching and design automation. Our platform helps turn simple sketches into sophisticated designs, enhances creative workflows, and facilitates collaboration with smart AI tools.

## Features

### AI-Powered Sketching

- **Automated Sketch Refinement:** Transform rough sketches into detailed, polished drawings using AI algorithms.
- **Style Transfer:** Apply various artistic styles to sketches to create visually stunning results.
- **Adaptive Brush Tools:** AI-enhanced brushes that adapt to different drawing techniques and styles.

### Design Automation

- **Smart Design Generation:** Automatically generate complex designs and diagrams from basic inputs.
- **3D Conversion:** Convert 2D sketches into 3D models for better visualization and interaction.
- **Simulation and Analysis:** Simulate and analyze designs for functionality, performance, and aesthetics.

### Enhanced Collaboration

- **Real-Time Sketch Collaboration:** Work with others in real-time, with AI assisting in merging and refining contributions.
- **Feedback and Iteration:** Collect and integrate feedback using AI to continuously improve designs.

### Personalization and Customization

- **User-Driven Interface:** Customize the interface and tools to match your workflow and preferences.
- **AI Recommendations:** Get personalized recommendations for tools, styles, and techniques based on your usage patterns.

### Advanced Analytics

- **Design Quality Analysis:** Evaluate sketches and designs for quality, efficiency, and structural integrity.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Use historical data and AI to predict design performance and suggest improvements.

## Architecture

**AutoSketchAI** employs a modern, scalable architecture to deliver its features:

- **Serverless Microservices:** Utilize serverless technologies (e.g., Azure Functions) to handle tasks like sketch processing and design generation, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency.
- **Swagger API Documentation:** Document APIs using Swagger to provide clear, interactive documentation for developers.
- **Bash CLI Wrapper:** A command-line interface for interacting with the APIs, facilitating automation and integration with other tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com) for deploying serverless functions.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for running development scripts and tools.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for containerizing and deploying applications.
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for using the CLI wrapper.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/autosketchai.git
   cd autosketchai
   ```

2. **Set Up Serverless Functions:**

   - Follow the instructions in `azure-functions/README.md` to deploy and configure Azure Functions.

3. **Configure Swagger API Documentation:**

   - Refer to `swagger/README.md` for details on setting up and using Swagger for API documentation.

4. **Install the CLI Wrapper:**

   - Place the provided Bash scripts in a directory included in your `PATH`.

## API Documentation

The **AutoSketchAI** APIs are documented using Swagger. Access the interactive documentation to explore and test endpoints:

- **Swagger UI:** [View API Documentation](https://api.example.com/docs)

## Bash CLI Wrapper
